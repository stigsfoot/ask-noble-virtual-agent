# What’s next for data stewardship? Let’s analyze a few trends in data trust, privacy, and ethics through data governance. 


# Intro

After about [five years, two dozen speaking engagements](https://speakerdeck.com/stigsfoot) on the subject of data privacy, trust, and AI ethics, I noticed a trend, I’m often weaving a gloomy narrative. In my defense, netizens are concerned about the privacy of their data, [yet we feel powerless](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/314524) so though my rally cries seem dire, I think it’s been a good counterbalance.  \
Today [in honor of Data Privacy Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Privacy_Day), I’ll try to put a different spin on things, yes, we’ll look at some challenges but this time, I’ll try to shed a positive light on trends and data stewardship innovations emerging out of all the mistakes we’ve made in this current data economy.

Let’s start by defining what it means to be a good steward of your users’ data? Data Stewardship is what your organization does to respect your users right to data privacy. 

To accomplish this your organization implements the right measures to ensure the standards and processes for understanding the provenance of your data. You need to have governance measures for your data. You need to comply with regulations. Most important if this data is justifiably personally identifiable or sensitive, you need to translate what you know the users' data transparently whilst respecting their right to more information, consent, deletion etc. depending on the use case. 

I’m under no delusions that this is easy. But your users’ data is your users’ data, even when adjacent is not yours thus an important investment to make.

For a more formal definition of data stewardship see also [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com/resources/articles/what-is-data-stewardship.html).


# Challenges driving positive data stewardship trends


#### It's been a long time comin', but I know change gon' come ~ Sam Cooke (Ain't That Good News)

There are many challenges driving good stewardship of users’ data and these challenges all center around transparent user _context _or the lack of respecting users _choices _regarding their data, and mechanisms to empower users with _controls _over their data. 

That's right, most of the challenges driving good data stewardship from business center around m definition of Data Privacy that is the sum of **C**ontext, **C**ontrol, **C**hoice, and Respect my definition of Data Privacy and what my colleagues at XRSI incorporated into their [XR Safety and Privacy Framework](https://xrsi.org/publication/the-xrsi-privacy-framework) and what we dub 3C+R) is how I’ve often defined Data Privacy in my previous writing and talks on being good stewards of users' data.


### Context

1️⃣ Do you understand your data, lineage, provenance?

2️⃣ Do you translate your understanding to your users in a simple to understand way?

3️⃣ Are you as transparent with your users as your justified use of their data changes?


### Choice

1️⃣ Do you afford the user agency over their data?

2️⃣ How easy do you make it for your users to choose what they are willing to give up?

3️⃣ Do you do enough for example to satisfy the right to removal, or respect your users data consent requirements?


### Control

1️⃣ Do your users have control over their data

2️⃣ Do you have data governance principles, and measurable practices to secure, and protect user data?

3️⃣ Is the context and choice defined above actionable through your product experience?

Let’s look at context from an example that emerged during the writing of this post where the US Attorneys General from [Washington D.C.](https://twitter.com/nobleackerson/status/1485730425213497348), [Indiana](https://twitter.com/AGToddRokita/status/1486048697704239106?s=20), [Texas](https://twitter.com/TXAG/status/1485647637881757697), and the [State of Washington](https://twitter.com/AGOWA/status/1485650947762053126) filed separate lawsuits regarding Google’s lack of user context around the location tracking features, 

governance trends.


### Google faced challenges given it’s lack of Context, Choice, and Control 

According to the lawsuit, Google did not do enough to empower users to choose how their location data was going to be used. Google’s use of coercive means or “Dark Patterns” took away a users agency understand and act the context of their data use by google, 


### Context, Choice, and Control from the Users’ Standpoint

This could lead to apparent user harm when 


### Positive Sum opportunities that benefit companies and the customer

Let’s go deeper with a specific location based service like Google Maps. To get my location accurately, responsively, and in a timely way from my phone, Google maps needs continuous access to the phone’s sensors. That’s a net positive user experience for the user. For Google, this increases my engagement and retention of the app. 

So with this example how could Google justify the log of point locations gathered over a period? 

Google implemented a pretty useful service, using the telemetry gathered to give me a log of my trips using it’s timeline feature.

If executed with the right context, a user now knows the benefits of their data use, how safe and secure the data is, can choose to provide consent to get the value delivered from this innovation, and have the agency to revoke consent in an intuitive and accessible way. 

What’s more, following the 3-C’s google builds trust with it’s users. Trust in this context is the sum of transparency a company provides, value delivered, and data trust from an end-users acceptance of consequences if there were ever an issue.


# Trends towards respectful data stewardship


#### Respect is not expected, but it's given 'cause it's real ~DMX (How’s It Goin’ Down)

The following Pew Research study tells the story

Essentially 2022 trends encompass a push and pull between organizations and their users. Organizations are coming around to the reality that a growth in data leads to a growth in breaches, which lead to human harms, that lead to more regulation.

Organizations best practices on their data stewardship of users’ data helps them understand data provenance, origin lineage, harms, and impact. 


## Realtime data governance

Data governance is a collection of processes, roles, policies, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals. Source: [Talend.com](https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-governance/#:~:text=Data%20governance%20is%20a%20collection%20of%20processes%2C%20roles%2C%20policies%2C%20standards%2C%20and%20metrics%20that%20ensure%20the%20effective%20and%20efficient%20use%20of%20information%20in%20enabling%20an%20organization%20to%20achieve%20its%20goals.)

A balance of being transparent with how customer data is used, value delivery (basic product 101) and end users consequence acceptance. Governing data in realtime affords data trust but you can see how that can encompass business and market decisions when it comes to privacy.

## Data Provenance is a competitive advantage

Trends around understanding the data. Provenance, lineage, all the way to how the data is secured, retention policies etc.

Technocrats are looking at risk registering more often around data, data cataloging (business and technical metadata)


## Evolving regulatory landscape

Increase in breaches >> increase in user awareness >> increase in regulations and national privacy laws around the world. How does that affect product outcomes, design, development, delivery etc.


## New proposals to replace third-party browser cookies.

[Google announces topics](https://youtu.be/I9jzqbdxAdk) (video, blog post)

Google recently announced a new proposal to replace third-party cookies. This comes after it's previous proposal FLoC was widely criticized. 

Topics in this proposal determine areas of interest, like Fitness, Travel and Transportation, etc., based on a user's browsing history for that week and stores the data for three weeks before deleting it. 

This proposal fits nicely with the 3-C definition of Data Privacy. This makes me hopeful that if implemented as they claim, it will provide the user with clearer context as to what data is being gathered than traditional cookies and respect the users’ choices as to what my interests are.

Ads aren't going anywhere anytime soon and users increasingly expect more personalized ads wso for marketing professionals being able to understand the interests of your users companies propose the future  Google, topics are selected entirely on the user's device and do not involve any external devices. 



* When a user visits a website, Topics shares one topic from the past three weeks with the site and its advertising partners. 
* Chrome users can see and remove topics that they don't like or completely disable the feature. 
* A developer trial of Topics in Chrome will be launched soon to try out the feature.

Trends this year are improving your definition of fairness within your data for example eliminating bias from datasets to eliminate harm. A rise in the practice of the responsible use of AI is .

To measure outcomes, Product wants to answer questions like: do their data scientists have a practice, tools, and practice of interpreting model behavior?

Can they explain model prediction/inference to stakeholders in #3?

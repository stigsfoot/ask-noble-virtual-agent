## [SESSIONS](https://sessionize.com/nobleackerson#sessions)


### [Trustworthy AI for Enterprise: Enhancing LLMs](https://sessionize.com/s/nobleackerson/trustworthy-ai-for-enterprise-enhancing-llms/65900)

GPT Is an Unreliable Information Store \
Current large language models (LLMs) exhibit limitations in deductive reasoning and cognitive architecture, posing challenges to their reliability in enterprise applications. This talk presents novel techniques to address these limitations, evaluate, and improve LLM performance. \
 \
We will highlight the issue of epistemological blindness in LLMs and propose a solution using embeddings model endpoint and Vector Index DB for enhanced factual accuracy. Additionally, we will discuss innovative approaches to automate feature engineering, including Automatic Feature Extraction with LLMs and Langchain integration in an MLOps pipeline so that we can evaluate the accuracy of these tools. \
 \
This presentation aims to offer valuable insights for practitioners and researchers, contributing to developing responsible and trustworthy AI in enterprise contexts.

### [Fight AI bias with… bias](https://sessionize.com/s/nobleackerson/fight-ai-bias-with.-bias/55809)

How can we ensure that AI systems treat everyone fairly? \
 \
Human biases influence the outputs of an AI model. AI amplifies bias, and socio-technical harms impact fairness, adoption, safety, and well-being. \
Harms such as improperly implemented AI-driven predictive policing disproportionately affect legally protected classes of individuals and groups in the United States. \
 \
In this talk, Noble walks through tools/libraries to mitigate bias within your ML pipeline and explainability solutions with SHAP for explaining the predictions of machine learning models to avoid disproportionate product failure due to fairness and bias issues. \
 \
It’s so fitting that the 2022 theme for International Women’s Day was #BreakTheBias, so join Noble as he returns to Strangeloop to expand on the topic of bias, deconstruct techniques to de-bias datasets by example for building intelligent systems that are fair and equitable while increasing trust and adoption.

### [Technical constraints and privacy considerations for #UNID2020 mission](https://sessionize.com/s/nobleackerson/technical-constraints-and-privacy-considerations-f/65901)

During the 63rd Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, I was invited to join a panel of thought leaders and international practitioners on the impact and opportunities the UN "ID for all" presents and, from a technical perspective, address the intersection of technical feasibility, standards, and privacy regulations such as the EU's GDPR.

### [ARCore Parkour: Incorporating marker-based AR into your app](https://sessionize.com/s/nobleackerson/arcore-parkour-incorporating-marker-based-ar-into-/22914)

Data gathered through Augmented Reality, and vision camera systems help computers bridge information from the real and virtual worlds so that one understands the other. \
 \
Augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) were once technologies considered reserved for games and media entertainment. However, these emerging technologies are growing rapidly as many industries realize that the potential of these technologies can be game changers. These technologies represent potential new leaps in how business is run, data is collected, and even new value-add propositions. \
 \
In this talk, Noble Ackerson, a 7-year Augmented Reality Developer and Product Expert, shares development best practices and industry insights, with examples such as incorporating marker-based AR into your app and creating XR experiences that cannot happen anywhere else.


### [Product Innovation in a Privacy by Design World](https://sessionize.com/s/nobleackerson/product-innovation-in-a-privacy-by-design-world/22915)

Personal data privacy is a hot-button item today. It can often seem overly burdensome for the software developer looking to change the world. Established businesses may look at regulations and current data privacy trends as negatively impacting product innovation. \
 \
This is the wrong lens through which we should look at this. \
 \
In this talk, Noble walks through his framework to respect user privacy AND innovate around the growth in data, and the growth in regulations like the GDPR. \
He shares insights on human-centered design opportunities that can help the independent developer and an established corporation. \
Finally, he presents practical examples to minimize the data you collect and best practices for asking for data in software only when it provides value for the user.


### [AWE: Shadows of the emerging worlds](https://sessionize.com/s/nobleackerson/awe-shadows-of-the-emerging-worlds/65911)

Today we see advancement in practical applications of emerging technologies in our homes and at work. As these solutions grow towards ubiquity, so do the possible harms and obstacles to the world we all want to live in. \
 \
In this talk, Noble Ackerson walks through 3 data trust and ethics issues in XR specifically: \
 \
1. Dark patterns in XR - impact, example, opportunity; \
2. AI fairness & bias - impact, example, opportunity; \
3. Data privacy/trust and security - impact, example, opportunity. \
 \
He presents practical examples of principles to avoid wading into dark patterns within the shadows of the emerging world and how you optimize for trust through his explainability, context, control, and choice framework for good data stewardship.

Human biases influence the outputs of an AI model. AI amplifies bias, and socio-technical harms impact fairness, adoption, safety, and well-being. These harms disproportionately affect legally protected classes of individuals and groups in the United States.
